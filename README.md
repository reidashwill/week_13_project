# Animal Shelter API


#### By Reid Ashwill 

## Description
This API is designed to be used by an animal shelter.  It allows the user to do many userful things from a user and administrative standpoint.  There is currently no authentication in place because i have been unsucessful in testing authentication.  I would like to add authentication to a later build of this API to gain more knowledge in integration testing.
